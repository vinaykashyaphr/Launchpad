            <p>This document is for the first time
               user of XEP 4.5. If you have only limited experience with
               <a href="#xsl-fo">XSL-FO</a>, or are unfamiliar with the process of using XSLT and a
               formatter such as XEP, then this document is for you.
            </p>
            <p>Working from a simple (pre-prepared) XML example, you will
               produce both <a href="#pdf">PDF</a> and <a href="#ps">PostScript</a> output using XEP 4.5 
            </p>
            <p>This document shows two ways of working with XEP, one
               graphical and one using the command line. 
            </p>
            <p>Later, we can introduce errors into the example, and you will
               see how to find and correct them. 
            </p>
            <p>The XML document and its associated XSLT stylesheet to make a
               file ready for the XEP formatter are available in the
               <tt class="filename">~/examples</tt> directory of the XEP
               installation. I'm using the tilda <span class="bold"><b>(~
                     )</b></span> as a replacement for the directory into which you
               installed XEP 4.5
            </p>
            <p>Once you are familiar with the transformation, further
               options are offered to show  ways in which you can control the
               operation of XEP to generate the output you want.
            </p>
            <p>After reading it you will be able to use XEP with your own
               documents and the other components of XEP documentation as a
               reference.

            <p>XEP is a formatter. A tool used as part of a chain normally
               used to transform an XML input document into a printable document
               for distribution. The process consists of two steps. The first
               transforms the input document into a standard XML format (XSL-FO),
               the second generates the printable format from that intermediate
               form. XSL-FO can be considered as a specification for the
               formatting that you want for a particular document type.
            </p>
            <p>Starting with the file <tt class="filename">hammer.xml</tt>, a
               small XML file which is provided with the distribution of XEP
               4.5. If you installed XEP into <tt class="filename">\xep</tt> (or
               <tt class="filename">/xep</tt> on *nix), then this file will be found
               in the <tt class="filename">/xep/examples/hammer</tt> directory. If
               you are using a Windows operating system, please change all such
               path information from using the forward slash <span class="bold"><b>( / )</b></span>, to use the <span class="bold"><b>( \
                     )</b></span>.
            </p>
            <p>Open the file in any text editor. You will see its structure,
               having a root element named <tt class="sgmltag-element">manual</tt>, containing
               the remainder of the document, it has <tt class="sgmltag-element">chapter</tt>
               elements, each of which contains <tt class="sgmltag-element">p</tt>aragraphs (in
               <tt class="sgmltag-element">p</tt> tags) and so on. Use this file for your
               experiments until you have your own material and the knowledge to
               develop your own stylesheets. If you want to change it, keep a copy
               of the original file so you know what worked.
            </p>
            <p>In the same directory is a file named
               <tt class="filename">hammer.xsl</tt>, which is an XSLT stylesheet used
               to convert the source XML document into a specification for the XEP
               formatter. Feeding this specification to XEP can produce a PDF
               output document ready to print.
            </p>
            <p>This is the end to end process which will be described. </p>
            <p>
               The input file, marked up in XML, is fed to an XSLT
               transformer. XEP comes with one provided. The job of the
               transformer is to take the content in the source document, and
               depending on the element name and position (e.g. a paragraph or a
               list or a chapter title), to modify (transform) the markup or
               content, into the form used by XSL-FO, which specifies
               how XEP 4.5 should present the file ready for viewing or
               printing. If you want to see this vocabulary in use, have a look
               in the <tt class="filename">examples</tt> directory where you will find
               files with an extension of <tt class="filename">.fo</tt>, which is
               often used for this type of file.
            </p>
            <p>The second step feeds the XSL-FO document to the formatter,
               which creates and fills pages according to the specification laid
               out in the XSL-FO document. 
            </p>
            <p>Finally, dependant on the format specified, the formatter
               writes out the pages in either PDF or PostScript.
            </p>
            <p>Since most users simply want to produce PDF or PostScript
               from XML (or XSL-FO) XEP 4.5 may be used to perform all
               these processes as a single step.

            <p>In order to view Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) files,
               you will need a viewer. Adobe provide a free one.

            <p>If you don't have it on your computer, you can download
               and install it from the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html" target="_top">Adobe
                  	website</a>, free for personal use. Note where you install it,
               since you can set this in XEP Assistant, and view the PDF output
               file immediately when XEP has processed it.
            </p>
            <p>To view PostScript files, one of the options is to use a

            <p>With XEP is distributed a tool which enables the easy
               transformation of files in a graphical environment, suitable for
               users more familiar with a graphical interface. 
            </p>
            <p>Find the <tt class="filename">x4u.bat</tt> file in the
               distribution and click on it. This runs the Assistant. Under the
               file menu, select the <tt class="filename">hammer.xml</tt> file as the
               input file to process. Under the Formatting menu, select start,
               then tick the apply stylesheet box, and select
               <tt class="filename">hammer.xsl</tt> from the same directory. Since
               this is an XML file, both steps of the process are needed, the
               transformation to XSL-FO format, and the formatting into
               PDF.

            </p>
            <p>If you've never used the command line on Windows, it is
               available from the start menu, programs, and either directly as an
               option or as a tab from the acessories tab. Normally called
               <span class="emphasis"><em>Command prompt</em></span>. The window that pops up is
               the command line interface to Windows. If you type
               <b class="command">help</b> it responds by listing all the commands it
               understands. You may want to create a temporary directory to work
               in, perhaps <tt class="filename">c:\myfiles</tt>. If you avoid using
               spaces in the directory names, it makes working with the command
               line that much easier. 
            </p>
            <p>Taking the same example as previously, to format
               <tt class="filename">hammer.xml</tt> using
               <tt class="filename">hammer.xsl</tt>, to produce
               <tt class="filename">hammer.pdf</tt>, the following command line is
               used. The script <b class="command">xep.bat</b> is a part of the
               distribution, found in the top level installation
               directory. 
            </p>
            <p>The command below is split over 3 lines for
               readability. It should remain on one line, so just remove the \
               characters used to indicate a continuation line.
            </p>
            <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="97%">

</pre></td>
               </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Finally, as a command line exercise, to produce
               <tt class="filename">hammer.fo</tt>, the matching XSL-FO file.  If you
               can find out where <span class="application">java</span> is installed,
               and add it to your environment path variable.  If you installed

            <p>Rather fake, but in order to find and correct errors it is
               necessary to see how they are reported. Two potential sources of
               errors are possible. Firstly in the source XML document. It could
               be either syntax or validity. Secondly, an error in the input to
               XEP. Often generated by an XSLT conversion, where the properties
               are mis-used. XEP has a tool to validate this input and isolate
               the source of the error.
            </p>
            <p>Firstly then the source code error. Open the
               <tt class="filename">hammer.xml</tt> file, near the top there is an
               <tt class="sgmltag-element">annotation</tt> element. Modify the markup as

            </p>
            <p>The message is clear. The software expected an end tag of
               <tt class="sgmltag-element">p</tt>, and didn't find one. No indication of

            <p>Your display will vary a little from this, dependant on the
               location of your files, but the information is clear. Somewhere on
               line 23, the <span class="emphasis"><em>end tag</em></span> is suspect. Now remove
               the error, by replacing the <tt class="literal">&lt;/b&gt;</tt> with a
               <tt class="literal">&lt;/p&gt;</tt>, and re-run the transformation. The
               error will not show if you have cleared it. 
            </p>
            <p>This demonstrates the increased detail available from a two
               step process, which is just a nuisance on a correct file. 
            </p>
            <p>If you ran the command line transformation, using saxon,
               then you will have a file named <tt class="filename">hammer.fo</tt>,
               into which we can now insert an error, to view the second source
               of errors. 
            </p>
            <p>In summary. When converting from XML to PDF (or PostScript),
               errors may be detected in either of the two stages of the
               transformation. It is often easier to isolate from which stage the
               error is originating. Now to inject and detect an error in the
               second stage, the XSL-FO to PDF stage.
            </p>
            <p>Open up the <tt class="filename">hammer.fo</tt> file, using any
               text editor. Far more difficult to read, since much more is
               happening, but you should see the structure of the file if you
               spend a few minutes with it. In particular, look for that first
               paragraph again, where we inserted the error before. It looks
               different, since its now ready for the formatter. Look for

            <p>The <span class="application">validate</span> script, located in
               the distributeion directory has a single purpose, to spot these
               errors. The output could not be clearer, the text-align property
               cannot take a value of centre. To remove the error, either change
               the value to <span class="emphasis"><em>center</em></span>, or remove the
               attribute and its value. 
            </p>
            <p>Re-run the validator, and a successful validation will
               result. Since the normal source of such errors is the XSLT
               stylesheet, that is where you would normally locate and remove
               these errors, since the purpose of the stylesheet is to convert
               the source XML into the form you have just seen in
               <tt class="filename">hammer.fo</tt>. 
            </p>
            <p>That is a view of finding errors in the two stages. Although
               not normally done in two separate stages like that, it is worth
               remembering that it can be done this way, since it is often easier
               to locate errors, and the objective is to produce the output
               efficiently.
