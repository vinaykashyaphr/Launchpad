RenderX®, © 2005-2009

The Dynamic and Interactive PDF Forms (AcroForm) Example demonstrates this new functionality available as of:

- XEP version 4.16 (xep-4.16-yyyymmdd.zip) or later
- XEPWin version 2.2 that includes XEP version 4.16 (xepwin-2.2-4.16-yyymmdd.zip) or later
  and with the "PDF Forms output option" enabled in the license.xml key file.

At http://www.renderx.com/download/index.html you can request a trial of:

- XEP Desktop/Server Trial, or
- XEP for Windows Trial, or both
- and with the 'PDFForms output option for XEP Trial' option selected.

Install XEP even if an installed version exists. But always Unistall XEPWin before installing the new XEPWin version.

Execute XEP or XEPWin and test the Dynamic and Interactive PDF Forms (AcroForm) example provided by
selecting the 'pdfforms.xml' and applying the 'pdfforms.xsl'

View the resulting PDF and test the Submit and Email buttons.

You can compare your results with the 'pdfforms.orig.pdf' included.

We thank you for evaluating this new functionality.
